Analysis:
The serial version will take longer to execute since it runs all the computations sequentially.

The parallel version should execute faster (assuming there are multiple cores) because it distributes the work across multiple threads. This is especially beneficial when N is large.

Test with Different Values of N:
To properly assess performance differences, test the programs with a variety of values for N, such as:

N = 1000

N = 10000

N = 100000

As N increases, the parallel version should show a more significant performance improvement over the serial version, especially if your system has multiple processor cores.
